# Ame - a random discord bot made with python: 
## Installing:

1. Highly recommended that you do this in a venv
2. Just clone the repo and install the requirements
3. Inside `bot.py` add your token (remove the lines where I read token.txt ðŸ˜‚)
4. Run the `bot.py` 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/npc203/Ame-Discord-bot.git
cd Ame-Discord-bot
pip install -r requirements.txt
python "bot.py"
```

## Note:
- It's just a hobby bot with bad programming practices and its personalized only to my discord name so you probably need to tweak it,
- It's still in development so if at all u clone this be sure to change all the hardcoded channel ids.
- Change the eval function access to ur name inside the cogs and change the logs,facts stuff(yea im using discord channels as my database lol!)
- Also People with ("Admin","Owner","Co-Owner") roles can only access the admin commands
